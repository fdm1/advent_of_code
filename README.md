General setup:
- store session token in `.aoc_token`
- language setup is specific to the languages. Ones that haven't been done in a while might need some love.

Patterns to follow:
- share test inputs in `test_input/<YEAR>/<0-padded DAY>.txt`
- share inputs in `inputs/<YEAR>/<0-padded DAY>.txt`
- Download the file if it doesn't exist in the language puzzle runner.
