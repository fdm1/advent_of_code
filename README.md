Repo for working through [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) (and getting to know Travis CI)


### Running challenges:

#### Java
`./java/bin/run.sh <year> <day> [path/to/input/file.txt]`

#### Elixir
`./elixir/bin/run.sh <year> <day> <part> [path/to/input/file.txt]`

#### Rust
`./rust/scripts/run.sh <year> <day>`

Rust currently cannot take a different input file (easily), as it runs inside a docker container.

#### Python
Todo...They don't currently have an easy runner system in place
