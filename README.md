[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/fdm1/advent_of_code.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/fdm1/advent_of_code)

Repo for working through [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) (and getting to know Travis CI)

Years/languages (some attempts are very meager)

- 2015
  - Elixir
  - Java
  - Python

- 2017
  - Python
  - Rust

- 2019
  - Typescript

- 2020
  - Go

- 2021
  - Go (record 17 days)

### Running challenges (this may not work anymore):

#### Java
`./java/bin/run.sh <year> <day> [path/to/input/file.txt]`

- apparently only one day attempted in 2015

#### Elixir
`./elixir/bin/run.sh <year> <day> <part> [path/to/input/file.txt]`

- 2015 and 2018

#### Rust
`./rust/scripts/run.sh <year> <day>`

Rust currently cannot take a different input file (easily), as it runs inside a docker container.

#### Python
Todo...They don't currently have an easy runner system in place
